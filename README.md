# 🐍 Welcome to Your First Python Assignment!

Welcome to your first Python task using **GitHub Codespaces**! 🎉

This is just a **practice assignment** to help you get familiar with:

- Writing and running Python code in Codespaces
- Using the terminal (command line)
- Editing files in VS Code inside your browser

> 💡 Don't worry, this is just for practice. You don’t need to know Git or Python yet!

## 🔧 What to Do

1. Open the file called `hello.py` in this repository.
2. Follow the instructions inside the file (they're written as comments).
3. Use the terminal (bottom panel) to run your code by typing:

```bash
python3 hello.py
```

4. If it doesn’t work the first time — don’t panic. Read the error, fix it, and try again.
5. Once you see your name and a sum printed out, you're done!

🎯 The Task

Edit the file hello.py so that it:
- Prints a message like:
```
Hello, my name is Amina!
```

- Adds two numbers (e.g. 3 + 7)
- Prints the result like:

```
The result of 3 + 7 is 10
```

## Committing your Changes
Once you are done, please commit (i.e. "save") your changes with these git commands.
Run them one at a time.
1. `git add hello.py`
2. `git commit -m "Completed first assignment"`
3. `git push`
